MIQCP Presolve eliminated 2 rows and 2 columns.
Aggregator did 1 substitutions.
Reduced MIQCP has 70 rows, 198 columns, and 331 nonzeros.
Reduced MIQCP has 0 binaries, 32 generals, 0 SOSs, and 0 indicators.
Reduced MIQCP has 3 quadratic constraints.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.14 ticks)
MIP emphasis: balance optimality and feasibility.
MIP search method: dynamic search.
Parallel mode: deterministic, using up to 8 threads.
