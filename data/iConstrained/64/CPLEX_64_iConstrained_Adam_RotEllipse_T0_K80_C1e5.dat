MIQCP Presolve eliminated 2 rows and 2 columns.
Reduced MIQCP has 133 rows, 387 columns, and 4489 nonzeros.
Reduced MIQCP has 0 binaries, 64 generals, 0 SOSs, and 0 indicators.
Reduced MIQCP has 66 quadratic constraints.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (2.02 ticks)
MIP emphasis: balance optimality and feasibility.
MIP search method: dynamic search.
Parallel mode: deterministic, using up to 8 threads.
Dual infeasible due to empty column 'z(23)'.
